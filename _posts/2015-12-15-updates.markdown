<p>The domains peaceablewriter.com and jdeames.com are transitioning away from hosted WordPress to Github and Jekyll. A new experiment, ay? As well as a work in progress. The site will evolve as I learn about the new digs.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I wrote three original pilot scripts for whatever we are calling television these days. Like many others, my household has untethered cable and moved into the streaming age.</p>
<p>Two of the scripts are one-hour pilots, and one is a half-hour comedy of sorts. All scripts feature diverse casting, and all feature women as the protagonists. Uh... because that's the view from here! Information about scripts will be on the site soon.</p>
<p>This year was my fifth <a href="https://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo.</a> I've spent many years trying to figure out my relationship with prose fiction. Mostly I see stories as images and dialogue, and prose is so very different. (At least prose is different for me. Surely I'm not alone?) This year was a breakthrough for me, and I've a novel that feels worthy of my attention and effort. The long re-writing process of <strong>We Once Were Golden</strong> is now underway!</p>
