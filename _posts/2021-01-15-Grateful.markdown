<a href="https://poetryjumpsofftheshelf.com" target="_blank">Poetry Jumps off the Shelf!</a> selected one of  my senryu for their Contract Tracing Project. The project consists of haiku and <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-write-senryu-poems" target="_blank">senryu</a> about <strong>life during the pandemic.</strong> The poems are printed on postcards.

Shoshauna Shy launched Poetry Jumps Off the Shelf in 2004. The program has a history of creative methods for sending poetry out into the world. Poems have appeared on bookmarks, postcards palm-sized books, decals appearing on bicycles, notecards attached to maple syrup jugs, and in other unique formats and places.

I love this program and it's an honor to be included!
