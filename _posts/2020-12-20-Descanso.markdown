The Welter Journal published my story "Descanso" on Welter's new online site. You can read <a href="https://blogs.ubalt.edu/welter/fiction/descanso/" target="_blank">it here.</a>

I'm quite honored to be included in Welter's first venture into online publishing. The 55-year old Journal's run by students at the University of Baltimore. I lived in Baltimore a gazillion years ago leading to a bit of symmetry for me personally.

Hope you'll read and enjoy it.
