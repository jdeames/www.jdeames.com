The project consists of haiku and <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-write-senryu-poems" target="_blank">senryu</a> about <strong>life during the pandemic.</strong> The poems are printed on postcards.</p>

<p>Shoshauna Shy launched Poetry Jumps Off the Shelf in 2004. The program has a history of creative methods for sending poetry out into the world. Poems have appeared on bookmarks, postcards, palm-sized books, decals on bicycles, notecards attached to maple syrup jugs, and other unique formats and places.</p>
