<p><strong><em>Do Geese See God</em></strong> - Opening five pages. For lexicographer, Topher Llewellyn, life is all about the words until she's left without them after she's hit by lightning during a winter storm.</p>
<ul class="screenbox">
<ul class="action">Whenever TOPHER speaks in monologue or to people standing/sitting on the ledge, she speaks normally; she is her whole, able-bodied self. When she speaks at other times it is with whatever ease or difficulty as indicated in the scene. Often her verbs are dropped. As the story is being told in reverse, Topher's aphasic, or halting speech, will go from better to worse during the course of the play.</ul>
<ul class="action">The play travels backwards in time.</ul>

<ul class="character">ACT 1</ul>

<ul class="openp">AT RISE: </ul>
<ul class="openp">TOPHER paints at an easel.
Off to one side, there's a ledge/elevated 
platform where EDDIE sits.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">I wish you were here. I wish we could have a long conversation, back and forth, over Chess. Like the old days.</ul> 

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Except there were no old days like that, were there? I‚Äôm afraid you treated me like one of Sammy‚Äôs temporaries.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">I did. I‚Äôm sorry. Still, I wish we could have had a real conversation then.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">We‚Äôre having one now.</ul> 

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">In my mind.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Yes. I wish you‚Äôd get e-mail. When are you going to embrace the 21st Century?</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Technology is overrated.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Topher,you still own a turntable!</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">I still have record albums.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Nobody plays records anymore! Or watches black and white television on purpose. Maybe if you owned a cell phone, instead of the old hard-wired kind then maybe none of this would have happened--</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Stop it! I‚Äôve had my fill of electronic devices for awhile.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Well, if you won‚Äôt use e-mail, you could write me more often the old fashioned way with pen and paper.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Writing is laborious for me.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">But your letters are word perfect.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">If only I could--</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Listen, cheer up! Both of us are still here. Still hanging on.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Even if out of time and space.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Here, and out there, too, Toph. In real time and space. Don‚Äôt forget.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Not as free as here, and--</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="parenthetical">(interrupting, changing subject)</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">I got your letter yesterday.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="parenthetical">(beat)</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Did you notice the special stamp?</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">The spacesuit canvas. How did you--</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Not me, Lily did that.</ul> 

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Lily. Of course.</ul>

<ul class="actionp">LILY appears. She does not notice Eddie, because he is not really ‚Äúhere.‚Äù She gives Topher a long kiss.</ul>

<ul class="character">LILY</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Come to bed, love.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">S-s-soon.</ul>
<ul class="character">LILY considers the painting.</ul>

<ul class="character">LILY</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">It‚Äôs lovely. Like you‚Äôve carved away at the paper to bring out what was already there.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Watercolors, that quality. Have.</ul>

<ul class="character">LILY</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Yes, they do.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Like you. You, quality, too.</ul>

<ul class="actionp">Lily disappears. Topher continues painting.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">As I said, I got your letter, but it didn‚Äôt answer my question.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">You always have so many questions.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">You know the one I mean.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">The one about ghost words. Eddie, you‚Äôre showing alarming signs of turning into an authentic word freak.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Whose fault is that? Please. Talk to me about ghost words. Give an example.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">There are no examples, Eddie. ‚ÄúGhost words‚Äù are by nature nonexistent. They‚Äôre mistakes that find their way into a dictionary. Mistakes, once discovered, are dropped from a dictionary, vanishing forever from the lexicon. Therefore, my dear, there are no examples I want to give you.</ul> 

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">I love how you go on and on in your letters, just like that.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Talking, like this, in person, or on the phone, I can‚Äôt. Especially on the phone. Only slowly, on paper.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="parenthetical">(pointing to his brain)</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">But you can in here, in this metaphysical meeting place we‚Äôve created. Come on, Toph, a ghost word for little old me? I find them haunting. Words that come and go, you know?</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">No, there‚Äôs no romantic quality to things which never existed in the first place.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Just a few bad mistakes.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Lexicographers are human, aren‚Äôt we? One of the greatest, Samuel Johnson, said, ‚ÄúThere are, in every age, new errors to be rectified.‚Äù Even real words with a purpose come and go over time.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">You‚Äôre getting soft.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Lily and I are thinking of moving away from here. To some place less volatile.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Life is volatile, Toph. Are you ready to leave here?</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">It‚Äôs been nearly a whole year since my Divine Intervention.</ul> 

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">You mean since your accident.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">Now who‚Äôs being picky about word choice? When it happens to you, it feels very personal. It‚Äôs like the Gods have reached out of the sky and collectively smacked you across the face.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">You mean across the room.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">It was a metaphor.</ul>

<ul class="character">EDDIE</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">You make it sound like a betrayal. Which is it, a betrayal or an intervention? They‚Äôre not the same.</ul>

<ul class="character">TOPHER</ul>
<ul class="dialogue">It‚Äôs both. Nothing is ever the same afterwards.</ul>
