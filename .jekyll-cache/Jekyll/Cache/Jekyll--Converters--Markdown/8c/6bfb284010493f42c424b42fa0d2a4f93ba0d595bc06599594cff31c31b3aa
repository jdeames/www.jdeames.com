I"§<p>The Welter Journal published my story â€œDescansoâ€ on Welterâ€™s new online site. You can read <a href="https://blogs.ubalt.edu/welter/fiction/descanso/" target="_blank">it here.</a></p>

<p>Iâ€™m quite honored to be included in Welterâ€™s first venture into online publishing. The 55-year old Journalâ€™s run by students at the University of Baltimore. I lived in Baltimore a gazillion years ago leading to a bit of symmetry for me personally.</p>

<p>Hope youâ€™ll read and enjoy it.</p>
