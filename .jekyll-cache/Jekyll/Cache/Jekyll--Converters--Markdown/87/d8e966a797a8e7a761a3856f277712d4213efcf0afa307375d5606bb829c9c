I"“	<p>We call Walker the best dog in the world because sheâ€™s kind, she shares her toys, and she loves everyone. Itâ€™s her mission to let everyone pet and love on her. The social distancing during the pandemic has been challenging for Walker.</p>

<p>The one thing she wonâ€™t share is her ball. Well, unless youâ€™re human. Sheâ€™ll make sure every human in her vicinity has an opportunity to throw her ball and receive it back slobbered up.</p>

<p><img class="col one left" alt="Walker's Basket Ball" src="/assets/img/walker/wbasketball.jpg" />Walker has been obsessed with balls since she was a puppy. Her first obsession? Basketballs. One day at the dog park, she discovered a basketball, and henceforth, all the worldâ€™s basketballs were hers. We would let a little air out of them so that she could carry the basketballs more easily.</p>

<p>Today, she loves Jolly Balls. The goal, in between catching and retrieving, is to chew off the handle and then slowly create a hole big enough for her snout to fit. (Itâ€™s at that point the ball gets replaced because who wants a dog with a ball stuck on her nose?)<img class="col one right" alt="Walker's jolly ball" src="/assets/img/walker/wwalkingjb.jpg" /></p>

<p>We spotted Walker at the Louisville Metro Animal Shelter when she was a few weeks old. Sheâ€™d been abandoned and turned over to the shelter. We live by â€œadopt, donâ€™t shop.â€ If we didnâ€™t believe in adopting, we never would have met Walker, ay?</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll never forget the day we met Walker. Sheâ€™d recently been released from foster care and hadnâ€™t been at the shelter more than a few days. We took her out to the shelterâ€™s play area. She picked up some ratty old plastic toy, and with a beautiful twinkling side-glance, she invited us to come and play. We fell in love, of course.</p>

In June 2021, Walker will turn nine years old.  Although sheâ€™s a little slower than she used to be, sheâ€™s still a very playful dog. She insists that playing ball regularly throughout the day is fundamental to living.
Weâ€™re grateful for her joyful presence in our family.</p>

<p>Every writer needs a dog</p>

<p>or a cat</p>

<p>or a betta fish. <em>Something</em> greater than the human self.</p>
