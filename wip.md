      <p>5/28/2019: Apologies that the website has some quirks.</p>
      <p>If you're on the front page & see the collapsible menu,</p>
      <p>you won't be able to click on "notes" from the menu. Only on</p>
      <p>the front page, though. Seems to work everywhere else.</>
      <p>We're workin' on that.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Soon, too, there will be notes, and perhaps excerpts,</p> 
      <p>from current work that's in progress.</p>
      <p>For the truly curious, ay?</p>
       <p></p>
      <p>Thank you for caring, dear friends.</p>
