<p>My stories often explore how we come back together after we've been driven apart. I'm deeply concerned about life in all its forms, our humanity, and our survival both practically and spiritually.</p>

<p>My first <em>writing-world</em> has been the theatre, and my plays have been performed in San Francisco, San Diego, New York, Chicago, and Alaska.</p>

<p>A founding member of West Coast Playwrights Alliance, a playwright-managed theatre company (1999-2001), the WCPA premiered my play <strong>Never Say Grace</strong> in November 2000. 
I'm a grateful alumnus of the oldest playwrights’ workshop in the Bay Area, <a href="http://mondaynightgroup.net" target="blank">The Monday Night Group.</a></p>

<p>Playwright <a href="http://www.willdunne.com" target="_blank">Will Dunne</a> was my teacher for a number of years. He taught me how to receive feedback, be a collaborator, and write better plays. I've also studied screenwriting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dalessandro" target="_blank">James D'Allesandro,</a> television writing with <a href="http://tvwriter.net" target="_blank">Larry Brody,</a> and survived an intensive in Los Angeles at <a href="http://www.writersbootcamp.com" target="_blank">The Writer's Boot Camp.</a></p>
<p>More recently, I've shifted from writing plays and scripts to writing novels. A wonderful mentor during this transition has been <a href="http://trackingwonder.com" target="blank">the poet and wonder-tracker, Jeffrey Davis.</a></p>
<p>Each and every re-write is fueled by an impossible teaching of <a href="http://www.augustwilson.net" target="_blank">August Wilson's:</a> 
<blockquote>“My play ‘Jitney’ had just been rejected by the O’Neill Playwrights Conference twice. So I thought, “OK, it’s time to rise above your talent.’ But how do you do that?’ The answer was, ‘You can write below your talent, can’t you?’ So I decided to try writing the best play ever written...”–August Wilson, Seattle Times, January 23, 2005</blockquote>
<p>Born and raised in California, I've been a nomad for over thirty years. Always a westerner at heart, I finally settled in beautiful New Mexico, along with my beloved wife, and the best dog in the world, our Walker-girl.</p>
