<p>My stories often explore loss, grief, interconnectedness, and how—or if—we come back together after we've been driven apart. I'm deeply interested in life in all its forms (human, animal, feathered, not); concerned about our humanity and our survival both practically and spiritually.</p>
<p>My first writing-world has been the theatre, and my plays have been performed in San Francisco, San Diego, New York, Chicago, Florida and Alaska.

<br><br>A founding member of West Coast Playwrights Alliance, a playwright-managed theatre company (1999-2001), the WCPA premiered my play <strong>Never Say Grace</strong> in November 2000. 
I'm a grateful alumnus of the oldest playwrights’ workshop in the Bay Area, The Monday Night Group.
<br><br>I've studied with several people over the years, but two writers were especially influential and I'm forever grateful for their mentorship:
<br><br>First and foremost playwright <a href="http://www.willdunne.com" target="_blank"><strong>Will Dunne</strong></a> taught me all the fundamentals: how to construct plays, receive feedback, and be a collaborator. He always pushed for my plays to be better.
<br>
<br>When I decided to shift from scripts to prose, the poet and wonder-tracker, <a href="http://trackingwonder.com" target="blank"><strong>Jeffrey Davis</strong></a> taught me how to structure a novel, and how to wrap my dialogue-laden brain around novel writing.
<br>
<br>Writers know that writing is more than just a first draft. There's a lot of re-writing, often countless further drafts, then editing, and finally polishing. For me, each and every re-write is fueled by an impossible yet inspiring teaching of <a href="http://www.augustwilson.net" target="_blank"><strong>August Wilson's:</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>“My play ‘Jitney’ had just been rejected by the O’Neill Playwrights Conference twice. So I thought, “OK, it’s time to rise above your talent.’ But how do you do that?’ The answer was, ‘You can write below your talent, can’t you?’ So I decided to try writing the best play ever written...”–August Wilson, Seattle Times, January 23, 2005</blockquote>

<p>Born and raised in California, I've been a nomad for over thirty years. Finally finding home in beautiful New Mexico, I live here with my beloved wife, and the best dog in the world, our Walker-girl.</p>
